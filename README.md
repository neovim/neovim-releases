# Unsupported Nvim releases

[![Release](https://github.com/neovim/neovim-releases/actions/workflows/release.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/neovim/neovim-releases/actions/workflows/release.yml)

This repo provides best-effort, [unsupported builds](https://github.com/neovim/neovim-releases/releases)
(as opposed to the [supported builds](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases)) of Nvim for some legacy
systems or other quirky scenarios:

- Linux (built with glibc 2.27, unlike the [supported builds](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases)
  which use a newer glibc)
    - Appimage
    - tar.gz
    - deb
